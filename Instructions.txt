INSTRUCTIONS
===================================================================================================================
Prerequisites: The build and execution of the code requires IDE setup of MATLAB Version :R2013a.


1. 	The folder titled "Heterogenous_Ring" contains the set of functions involved to simulate the 
	devised protocol LBRR(Load Balanced Ring Routing). for the paper titled "Load Balanced Ring 
	Routing Protocol for Heterogeneous Sensor Networks with Sink Mobility" accepeted for 
	publication in IEEE WCNC 2017.
	
	The simulation distibutes the heterogeneousring nodes in the specified area, identify possible 
	ring candidates and using range seach it determines the candidates with maximum angle as the next
	candidate. It demonstrates the ring expansion and compression, Anchor node identification, sink node 
	movement and calculates multiple aspects to compare the two simulations by packet drop ratio
	network life.etc.

	
	
	The script file for the simulation is titled as "Heterogenous.m"




2.	Ther file titled "Normal_Ring" contains the simulation for the research publication taken as 
	a base for further development titled "Ring Routing: An Energy-Efficient Routing Protocol 
	for Wireless Sensor Networks with a Mobile Sink".
	This simulation does the functions mentioned for the ring routing protocol in the paper and 
	calculates the packet drop ratio, network life.etc for comparison with our simulation.  
	
	The script file for the simulation is titled as "Main.m".

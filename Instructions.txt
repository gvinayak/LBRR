===================================================================================================================
Pre-requisites: The build and execution of the code requires setup of MATLAB Version :R2013a.

1. 	The folder titled "Heterogenous_Ring" contains the set of functions involved to simulate the 
	devised protocol LBRR(Load Balanced Ring Routing). for the paper titled "Load Balanced Ring 
	Routing Protocol for Heterogeneous Sensor Networks with Sink Mobility" in IEEE WCNC 2017.
	
	The simulation distibutes the heterogeneousring nodes in the specified area, identify possible 
	ring candidates and using range seach it determines the candidates with maximum angle as the next
	candidate. 

	It demonstrates the ring expansion and compression, anchor node identification, sink node 
	movement and calculates multiple aspects to compare the two simulations by packet drop ratio
	network life.etc.
	
	The main file for the simulation is titled as "Heterogenous.m"


2.	Ther file titled "Normal_Ring" contains the simulation for the research publication taken as 
	a base for further development titled "Ring Routing: An Energy-Efficient Routing Protocol 
	for Wireless Sensor Networks with a Mobile Sink" in  IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing 2014.

	The main file for the simulation is titled as "Main.m".
